# Code of Conduct for WPlace-AutoBOTV2 / GuardBOT

> This project aims to foster an open, safe, and collaborative community around the responsible development and use of automations and bots.

## Our Promise
We are committed to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of age, appearance, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, political affiliation, religion, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics.

## Our Standards

### Behaviors We Encourage
- Show empathy, respect, and kindness in interactions.
- Accept constructive criticism with openness.
- Take responsibility for mistakes, offer apologies, and learn from the experience.
- Share knowledge and document technical decisions.
- Prioritize security, privacy, and responsible software use.

### Unacceptable Behaviors
- Insults, sexualized language or images, harassment, threats, or personal attacks.
- Trolling, deliberate provocations, or continuous disparagement.
- Disclosure of third-party personal information without consent (doxing).
- Any form of social engineering, identity theft, or unauthorized access attempts.
- Encouraging, facilitating, or executing service abuses (spam, scraping that violates TOS, bypassing rate-limits, attacks, fraud, or misuse of APIs).
- Submitting contributions with malicious code, backdoors, or tampered dependencies.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces:
- Repositories, issues, discussions, pull requests, wikis, releases.
- Chat channels, meetings, and related community spaces.
- Public interactions referencing the project or its members.

## Security, Abuse, and Responsible Use
This project involves automation and possible interactions with third-party services. To protect the community and service providers:

- **Respect the Terms of Service and usage limits** of the platforms the bot interacts with.
- **Prohibited**: automating harassment, spam, aggressive scraping, metric manipulation, or any activity that harms services or people.
- **Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities**: if you find a security flaw, **do not open a public issue**. Use the private channel described in _“How to Report”_.
- Do not publish **tokens, credentials, or personal data**. Use `.env`, GitHub Secrets, and good secret management practices.

## Privacy and Data
- Treat all personal data in accordance with applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR in the EU).
- Minimize data collection. Limit logs and scrub sensitive data.
- Do not share datasets with identifiable information without legal basis and proper anonymization.

## Responsible AI and Automation
- Clearly label bot-generated content and actions when appropriate.
- Avoid harmful biases and review outputs to prevent harm.
- Do not design or contribute to features intended to bypass platform security, moderation, or integrity controls.

## Enforcement

The maintenance team may take proportional action against behaviors that violate this Code, including:

1. **Private observation**: Informal request to modify behavior.
2. **Warning**: Formal notification and internal record.
3. **Temporary limitation**: Temporary restriction of participation (issues/PRs/discussions).
4. **Blocking**: Expulsion from project spaces.
5. **Escalation**: If appropriate, report to the platform (GitHub) or relevant entities in case of legal or security risks.

Decisions will consider context, intent, impact, and collaboration history.

## How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- **Confidential contact**: `YOUR_EMAIL@example.com` (replace with a contact email)  
	Alternatives:
	- **GitHub Security Advisory** (recommended for security issues): create a *Private Vulnerability Report* in the repo if enabled.
	- **Private form**: (optional; add link if enabled).

Include, when possible:
- Description of the incident (with dates and URLs of issues/PRs/commits).
- Evidence (screenshots, links).
- Involved users and witnesses.
- Level of urgency (especially in security cases).

**Response Commitment**: We will make an initial assessment and respond via the same channel within a reasonable time. Your report will be treated confidentially. We will not share your identity without your consent, except as required by law.

## Maintainer Guide (Summary)
- Be impartial: evaluate facts and evidence.
- Request clarifications privately when safe to do so.
- Document warnings and decisions (internal record).
- Apply proportional, temporary measures if possible, and explain the reason.
- In complex cases, seek a second opinion from another maintainer.

## Reinstatement and Appeals
Persons subject to measures may request review after a reasonable period, demonstrating understanding of the impact and commitment to change. Send the request to the indicated contact channel.

## Attribution
This Code is inspired by best practices from various open source communities and documents such as the **Contributor Covenant** (v2.x), adapted to the specific context of automation/bots.  
You may reuse and adapt this document in your projects, ideally keeping a note of attribution.
